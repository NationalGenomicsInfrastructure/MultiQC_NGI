# MuiltiQC NGI Example Config
#

# This is an example MultiQC NGI config file.
# These settings should be added to a MultiQC config file:
# - <MQC_installation_dir>/multiqc_config.yaml
# - ~/.multiqc_config.yaml
# - Specify a path with -c

# NB: This is NOT the config file that is used in production,
# it is only an example config to keep track of useful settings.

# Note that you may not need all of this if running personally.
# Just use the sections that you feel are relevent.
